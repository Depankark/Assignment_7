1):-Create a function to calculate the area of a circle by taking radius from user.
  
Ans:-
    
def function(rad):
    area=3.14*rad*rad;
    print(area)
radius=int(input("enter radius: "))
print("area is :")
function(radius)


2):-Write a function “perfect()” that determines if parameter number is a perfect number. Use this function in a program that determines and prints all the perfect numbers between 1 and 1000. 
[An integer number is said to be “perfect number” if its factors, including 1(but not the number itself), sum to the number. E.g., 6 is a perfect number because 6=1+2+3].

Ans:-

     def perfect_number(n):
    sum=0
    for x in range(1,n):
        if n % x == 0:
            sum+=x
    if sum==n:
        print("yes ",n)
for i in range(1,1001):
    perfect_number(i)




4):-Write a function to calculate power of a number raised to other ( a^b ) using recursion.


Ans:-     
       import math
base=int(input("enter the base number: "))
exponent=int(input("enter the power to be raised: "))
value=pow(base,exponent)
print("answer: ",value)




5):-Write a function to find factorial of a number but also store the factorials calculated in a dictionary

Ans:-

    def factorial(n):
    if n==0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n*factorial(n-1)
n=int(input('enter a number to calculate the factorial: '))
print("the factorial is: ",factorial(n))
